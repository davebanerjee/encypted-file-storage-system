## Weighting Per Part


| Part | Weight|
| -------------  |  -----:|
| Part0 (Written)|  10% |
| Part1 (HMAC)   |  30% |
| Part2 (AES)    |  30% |
| Part3 (cstore) |  30% |

## Part 1 and Part 2 will be graded on the following points: 

* Code compiles - you are given working code and should not turn in a broken product

* Code is internally consistent (if it is incorrect in implementation, it is at least internally consistent)

* Code is correct per the specification

* Code does not have memory leaks or logic errors

## Part 3 will be graded on the following points 

* Code compiles - you are given working code and should not turn in a broken product

* Code is internally consistent (if it is incorrect in implementation, it is at least internally consistent)

* Code does not have memory leaks or logic errors

* Code performs the tasks according to specification

  * List correctly lists files

  * Add correctly adds files

  * Extract correctly extracts a file

* Code is cryptographically secure and detects when an archive is tampered with
