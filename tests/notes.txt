NOTE: add hmac-verify to part 1

- use python to test

tests:

 - verify -p option behaves as expected in all programs

 - generate hmac for file and see if program correctly validates it
 - generate incorrect hmac for file and see if program detects a match
 - generate a file and have the program create an hmac of the file; independently verify

 - encrypt file and decrypt it and verify hashes match
 - encrypt file with tool and manually decrypt it and verify AES is correct
 - encrypt file with python and decrypt with tool and verify AES is correct
 - tamper with encrypted file and ensure output does not match when decrypted

 - andrew's tests for cstore
